# Sudoku
This is a mini-project. 
This web app can process sudoku puzzles and solve them. It can only solve simple puzzles with directly simple deduction and does not use a brute force approach. A second version will be created that can solve harder problems and will be able to determine if the puzzle is impossible or has more than one solution

Still working on functionality
